# Vue-Instance-uid-1-2-error
Vue Dev Tools in Firefox generated an Instance uid=1:2 error upon activation.

Whenever any error occurs in console when using Vue, I quickly attempt to determine the cause, as it might indicate a fault in my code.

For example, the following error appeared in my console whenever I activated the Vue Dev Tools.

As this might cause some confusion as to the source, it still required some time for figuring-out where it came from.

Therefore, the two screenshots, with and without Vue Dev Tools active.

Also, it appears that I was not up-to-date with current release of Vue Dev Tools.

Sometimes, the days go by without thinking about auto update.

I updated, and now the new error is also gone.

The new Vue Dev Tools solved the previous error.

And,

Relief that my code was not the source of error.
